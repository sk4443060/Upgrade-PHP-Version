To upgrade your PHP version to PHP 8.2 in XAMPP, you'll need to manually update the PHP version in your XAMPP installation. Here's a step-by-step guide to do that:

1. Download PHP

     - Go to the official PHP download page for Windows: PHP Downloads for Windows.
     - Download the Thread Safe version for your system. Choose the appropriate version based on your system architecture (x64 for 64-bit Windows).

     For PHP 8.2, you can download the VC15 x64 Thread Safe version (or VC16 if available).

2. Backup Your Current PHP Folder

    - Before you do anything, it’s a good idea to backup your current PHP setup:
    - Navigate to your XAMPP installation folder, typically located in C:\xampp\.
    - Inside the xampp folder, locate the php directory and copy it somewhere safe (for example, to your desktop or another folder) as a backup.
  
3. Extract the New PHP Version

    - Once the PHP 8.2 download is complete, extract the ZIP file.
    - Copy the extracted php folder into your XAMPP directory (replacing the current php folder).
    - For example, if you downloaded PHP 8.2, you’ll have a folder called php-8.2.x after extraction. Rename that folder to simply php.

    Make sure to replace the existing php folder under C:\xampp\php.

4. Update PHP Configuration Files

    - You will need to copy over the php.ini and other configuration files from the old PHP folder to the new one:
    - In your old PHP folder (the backup you made earlier), copy the php.ini file.
    - Paste it into the new php folder (the one you just copied from PHP 8.2).

If you had any custom settings in php.ini (like extensions or environment settings), ensure they are transferred properly.

Note: Sometimes, php.ini settings may vary slightly between versions, so review the new php.ini file and make sure everything is configured properly.

5. Update httpd-xampp.conf File

    - You also need to update the Apache configuration to point to the new PHP version.
        1. Navigate to the apache folder inside your XAMPP installation (C:\xampp\apache\conf\extra).
        2. Open the file httpd-xampp.conf in a text editor.
        3. Look for the line that contains PHPIniDir. It should look something like this:
     
               PHPIniDir "C:/xampp/php"

        4. Ensure that the path is pointing to the correct php folder (C:/xampp/php), and update it if necessary.
     
6. Restart Apache Server

    - After making these changes, go to the XAMPP Control Panel and stop the Apache server if it’s running.
    - Click Start again to restart Apache with the new PHP version.
  
7. Verify the PHP Version

    - Once Apache restarts, open Command Prompt and run:

          php -v

    - This should display PHP 8.2. If everything was done correctly, you should see something like:
  
          PHP 8.2.x (cli) (built: YYYY-MM-DD)

8. Test Your Applications

    - Finally, ensure that all your PHP applications and scripts are working correctly with the new PHP version.
    - Some older PHP code may need adjustments due to breaking changes in PHP 8.2.

Optional: Reinstall XAMPP (if preferred)

  - If you want an easier method, you can reinstall XAMPP with the latest version that includes PHP 8.2.
  - Just uninstall your current XAMPP version, download the latest XAMPP with PHP 8.2 from XAMPP website, and install it.
